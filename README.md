This training mode is still in development and you may encounter bugs or missing features while using it. Please report anything weird on the [issues page](https://github.com/Grouflon/3rd_training_lua/issues).

If you wish to contribute or give any feedback, feel free to get in touch or submit pull requests.

## Troubleshooting
**Q: Missing rom, zip file not found**

A: Make sure you have the proper roms. You must have at least 2 roms: _sfiii3.zip_ and _sfiii3a.zip_. sfiii3 is the japanese version and the zip contains _sfiii3_japan_nocd.29f400.u2_. sfiiia is the american version and contains _sfiii3_usa.29f400.u2_.

You may need to rename zip files so they match exactly what the emulator expect for.

**Q: Emulator crash when I run lua script**

A: Check video settings, you musn't use "Enhanced" blitter option.

**Q: UI looks weird and hitboxes are misplaced**

A: Check video settings, you must use "Basic" blitter option with no scanlines if you want the UI to work properly.

**Q: Emulator doesn't run at all, there's a missing dll**

A: Install prerequires from [here](https://github.com/TASVideos/BizHawk-Prereqs/releases/latest/)
